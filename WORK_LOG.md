But the differnece is that we are comparing text instead of ints. Also we have two texts whereas heating up only had one array of ints and not two. I also wonder if shared substrings have to be in the same place in both texts or if they can be in different spots. |

Here I want to find in the optimal substructure of this problem; thats how I will be able to use dynamic programming. ABAZDC BACBAD could be my two texts and lets say I start after AB in text 1 and after BA in text 2. Maybe sort of like making change I can either in keep or remove the letter and save the string. Now that I have a lot of strings saved in an array of Strings for each text I could maybe just find the longest string that is the same between the two arrays. |
| Feb 5 |  3:20-3:50pm  | My previous "solution" seems to be quite inefficient but I wonder if I'm on the right track even a little bit. Anyways we could hash the strings to make matching faster but with hashing I suppose we couldn't see the length of the string. Anyways maybe I can come up with a memoization type of solution. With my potential recurssive solution, you definietly could get to the same word or mix of characters in different ways so memoization is worth it. Now that I'm thinking to memoize I think there is something pretty wrong with my solution and that Im not actually using dynamic programming. With my solution Im only saving strings into an array and not actually doing anything with that information. Im not returning it or anything so I don't think I actually found the optimal substructure. |

When I recurse am I looking at both documents at the same time? I'm looking back to heating up for some insperation on the optimal substructure but I keep getting messed up because of the fact that we are comparing two documents. What also confuses me a bit is that it seems like the substrings from each text don't have to be in the smae place but can be anywhere which I think means we probably cannot directly look at the texts side by side at the same time. |
